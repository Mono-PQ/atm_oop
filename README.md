# Basic Object-oriented Programming for ATM terminal simulation in Python

## Introduction
A simulation of a scaled down version of an automated teller machine (ATM) using basic object orientation principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism. All codes and scripts are written in Python. 

## Assumptions 
- Each customer has either savings or current, or both accounts. There will not be any customer with more than two types of account. 
- Only one bank and one ATM teller used for the simulation. Number of customers, ATM cards and accounts would not be restricted. 
- Each customer only owns one ATM card.

## Scripts 
There are a total of 8 scripts for each class as follows. 
- account.py
- additionalexceptions.py
- atm.py 
- atmcard.py
- atmtransactions.py
- bank.py
- customer.py
- main.py

To run the program, you can download all the scripts and run the `test.py` file in the terminal to start the simulation. You can also edit the file to create different objects for testing.

## Disclaimer
As the above is a mini-project done for a programming course, the design of the program is minimal.
